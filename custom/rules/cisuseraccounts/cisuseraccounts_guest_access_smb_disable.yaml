title: 'Disable "Allow guests to connect to shared folders" (Automated)'
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  Allowing guests to connect to shared folders enables users to access selected shared folders and their contents from different computers on a network.

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Not allowing guests to connect to shared folders mitigates the risk of an untrusted user doing basic reconnaissance and possibly use privilege escalation attacks to take control of the system.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Unauthorized users could access shared files on the system.
