title: "Turn on filename extensions (Automated)"
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  A filename extension is a suffix added to a base filename that indicates the base filename's file format.

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Visible filename extensions allow the user to identify the file type and the application it is associated with which leads to quick identification of misrepresented malicious files.
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  The user of the system can open files of unknown or unexpected filetypes if the extension is not visible.
